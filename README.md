# MemoryCardGame

### How to Install

###### Note: Most of these steps should be done for you already.

1. Compile the program.
2. Navigate to the folder containing MemoryCardGame package/folder with the compiled classes in File Explorer.
3. Place bat files there, as well as your db.properties file, and all the .jar libraries needed (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar, junit-4.13.2.jar, mysql-connector-java-5.1.40-bin.jar, and 
   ocsf.jar).
4. Please note that this program was built against Java 16, but can likely be built using as low as Java 14 (Pattern Matching for instanceof Operator).
5. Please launch the server bat file first.
6. Then launch two client bat files for two clients.
7. Create two accounts as you please, then press 'Join' to join a game with the other client.
8. Struggle through the memorization game.
9. Cancel because it takes too long to solve correctly OR continue playing until one client has more than half of the cards matched.
